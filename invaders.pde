/*
  This program will simulate the movement seen in the
  arcade classic "Space Invaders". Our invaders will be
  circles, and there will be 2 kinds of them.

  0. The "spaceship" is a smaller circle that moves
    horizontally across the screen from left to right.
    This movement should be smooth, and the full spaceship
    should always be visible.

  1. The "invaders" are larger circles arranged in a
    rectangular grid. The invaders move as a single group.

    The grid always moves in steps the same size as a single
    circle.

    The grid starts off moving left to right, when the
    grid would move off the edge of the screen, it should
    move down. After moving down, the grid should then move
    right to left, moving and down and reversing direction
    once reaching the other edge.

    When the grid would go past the bottom of the screen,
    it should reset back to the top, moving left to right
    again.

  This assignment is broken up into 3 parts. The code you
  need to complete each part is clearly labeled. Do not
  move to a new part until you have completed the previous
  ones.

  PART 0: Draw the spacehip that moves across the screen.

  PART 1: Draw a the invader gird. This part involves NO
          MOVEMENT of the grid.

  PART 2: Handle the movement of the invader grid.
